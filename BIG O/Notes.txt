Omega(best case) , Theta(Average Case) and Omicron(O)(Worst case), can be denoted by, So technically when we talk about Big 0 we are talking about Worst Case Only

O(n) proportional


So, In summary

0(1) Excellent
O(log n) - good
O(n) - fair
O(n log n) - bad
O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(n!) Worst 


BIG O List:

    append, pop and end  = o(1)
    adding or removing from start in a list O(n)
    inserting t mid or remove  O(n)

    searching by index is O(1)
    loop through is O(n)
